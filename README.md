# LibAurora
This is just a self-developed engine based on Raylib_cs. But I welcome more interested developers to use it, why not? (Anyway, I wrote the complete XML document)

## How can I used it?
- First, make sure your project is using DotNet 10 or above.
- Second, just clone this repository and reference it in your project. (I will publish a nuget package after this lib is fully developed, but not right now.)

## What features dose it have? What should I implement by myself?
The following are list of features. Some of them might be still under development.

- [x] Independent Rendering Loop and Logic Loop
- [x] Multifunctional and High-performance Sprite Batch Drawing (Contains shader functionlity)
- [x] Mapping of Input and Action
- [x] Space Querying (SpatialGrid/QuadTree)
